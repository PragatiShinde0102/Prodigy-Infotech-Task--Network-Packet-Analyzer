# 🌐 Network Packet Analyzer

A Python-based GUI **Network Packet Analyzer** built with Scapy and Tkinter.  
It captures, filters, and analyzes live network traffic in real time, with options to export captured data for further analysis.

---

## ✨ Features
- 📡 **Live Packet Capture** – Start and stop real-time traffic monitoring  
- 🎯 **Protocol Filtering** – Filter by TCP, UDP, ICMP, or capture all packets  
- 📊 **Detailed Insights** – View source IP, destination IP, protocol, and payload  
- 💾 **Export Options** – Save captured data as TXT or CSV files  
- 🖥️ **User-Friendly GUI** – Interactive interface using Tkinter  

---

## 🚀 Purpose
This project demonstrates:
- Practical knowledge of **network traffic analysis**  
- Hands-on use of **Scapy for packet sniffing**  
- Building interactive tools with **Python Tkinter**  
- Applying **multithreading and file handling** in real applications  
- Relevance of packet analysis for **cybersecurity and troubleshooting**  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**  
- **Scapy** – packet sniffing and analysis  
- **Tkinter** – GUI framework  
- **CSV / File Handling** – data export  

---

## 📌 How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install scapy

   🔮 Future Enhancements

📈 Visual Dashboards – Graphical charts for packet statistics (protocol distribution, traffic volume, etc.)

🔍 Advanced Protocol Decoding – Support for HTTP, DNS, and other higher-layer protocols

🚨 Security Alerts – Detect suspicious traffic patterns for intrusion detection

☁️ Cloud Export – Save logs directly to cloud storage for collaboration and analysis

📄 Conclusion

The Network Packet Analyzer showcases a blend of networking, security, and Python development skills.
It reflects my ability to design tools that are both practical for analysis and forward-looking for cybersecurity applications.
